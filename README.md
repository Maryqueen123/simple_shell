##Description 
A simple UNIX command interpreter that replicates functionalities of the simple shell (sh). Additional functions are also included. This program was written entirely in C as a milestone project for ALX Africa Software Engineering.

##Purpose
The purpose of the simple shell project is to understand:
* how a shell works
* PID and PPIDs
* how processes are created
* the three prototypes of `main`
* how the shell uses the `PATH` to find and execute programs
* the `EOF`/"end-of-file" condition

## Requirements

* Must follow [Betty](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/wiki) style and document guidelines
* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* Must have a `README.md` file
* All header files must be include guarded
* No more than 5 functions per files

## Compilation

```gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic *.c -o hsh```
